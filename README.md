# Student Portal 
A Student Portal made using PHP with MySQL.
* To make the life of a student a bit more easy, we made 'Student Portal', a simple yet useful app to help the student push their limit a bit more further. 
* With the Student Portal , our goal is to help you find and learn the information and ensure a smooth, seamless experience along the way. That’s why we’ve established the Student Portal. Here, you can view your progress and register for your classes online.
